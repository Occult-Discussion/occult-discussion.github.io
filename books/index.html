        <h2 style="margin-top: -1px;margin-left: 75px;">Sorcery or Science?: Contesting Knowledge and Practice in West African Sufi Texts - Ariela Marcus-Sells</h2>
        <p style="margin-left: 75px;">Sorcery or Science? examines how two Sufi Muslim theologians who rose to prominence in the western Sahara Desert in the late eighteenth century, Sīdi al-Mukhtār al-Kuntī (d. 1811) and his son and successor, Sīdi Muḥammad al-Kuntī (d. 1826), decisively influenced the development of Sufi Muslim thought in West Africa.
        <br>
        <br>
        Known as the Kunta scholars, Mukhtār al-Kuntī and Muḥammad al-Kuntī were influential teachers who developed a pedagogical network of students across the Sahara. In exploring their understanding of “the realm of the unseen”―a vast, invisible world that is both surrounded and interpenetrated by the visible world―Ariela Marcus-Sells reveals how these theologians developed a set of practices that depended on knowledge of this unseen world and that allowed practitioners to manipulate the visible and invisible realms. They called these practices “the sciences of the unseen.” While they acknowledged that some Muslims―particularly self-identified “white” Muslim elites―might consider these practices to be “sorcery,” the Kunta scholars argued that these were legitimate Islamic practices. Marcus-Sells situates their ideas and beliefs within the historical and cultural context of the Sahara Desert, surveying the cosmology and metaphysics of the realm of the unseen and the history of magical discourses within the Hellenistic and Arabo-Islamic worlds.
        <br>
        <br>
        Erudite and innovative, this volume connects the Islamic sciences of the unseen with the reception of Hellenistic discourses of magic and proposes a new methodology for reading written devotional aids in historical context. It will be welcomed by scholars of magic and specialists in Africana religious studies, Islamic occultism, and Islamic manuscript culture.</p>

        <h2 style="margin-top: -1px;">Paradiso - Dante's Divine Comedy - Dante</h2>
        <p>Dante ascends to the celestial realm in Paradiso, guided by Beatrice. He explores the nine spheres of Heaven, encountering various blessed souls who reveal deeper insights into divine wisdom, love, and the nature of God. Dante's journey symbolizes the soul's ascent towards union with God, exploring themes of faith, reason, divine illumination, and the ultimate goal of human existence. 
        <br>
        <br>
        The Paradiso showcases Dante's visionary and philosophical exploration of theological concepts, blending Christian theology with classical and medieval thought. It is a culmination of the Divine Comedy, offering a profound exploration of spirituality, metaphysics, and the nature of divine transcendence.</p>

        <h2 style="margin-top: -1px;margin-left: 75px;">Anti-Education - Friedrich Nietzsche</h2>
        <p style="margin-left: 75px;">
            
    In 1869, at the age of twenty-four, the precociously brilliant Friedrich Nietzsche was appointed to a professorship of classical philology at the University of Basel. He seemed marked for a successful and conventional academic career. Then the philosophy of Schopenhauer and the music of Wagner transformed his ambitions. The genius of such thinkers and makers—the kind of genius that had emerged in ancient Greece—this alone was the touchstone for true understanding. But how was education to serve genius, especially in a modern society marked more and more by an unholy alliance between academic specialization, mass-market journalism, and the militarized state? Something more than sturdy scholarship was called for. A new way of teaching and questioning, a new philosophy . . .
    <br>
    <br>
What that new way might be was the question Nietzsche broached in five vivid, popular public lectures in Basel in 1872. Anti-Education presents a provocative and timely reckoning with what remains one of the central challenges of the modern world.</p>

        <p style="margin-left: 75px;">
            
     During the Middle Ages, the Western world translated the incredible Arabic scientific corpus and imported it into Western culture: Arabic philosophy, optics, and physics, as well as alchemy, astrology, and talismanic magic. The line between the scientific and the magical was blurred. According to popular lore, magicians of the Middle Ages were trained in the art of magic in “magician schools” located in various metropolitan areas, such as Naples, Athens, and Toledo. It was common knowledge that magic was learned and that cities had schools designed to teach the dark arts. The Spanish city of Toledo, for example, was so renowned for its magic training schools that “the art of Toledo” was synonymous with “the art of magic.” Until Benedek Láng’s work on Unlocked Books, little had been known about the place of magic outside these major cities. A principal aim of Unlocked Books is to situate the role of central Europe as a center for the study of magic.
    <br>
    <br>
    Láng helps chart for us how the thinkers of that day—clerics, courtiers, and university masters—included in their libraries not only scientific and religious treatises but also texts related to the field of learned magic. These texts were all enlisted to solve life’s questions, whether they related to the outcome of an illness or the meaning of lines on one’s palm. Texts summoned angels or transmitted the recipe for a magic potion. Láng gathers magical texts that could have been used by practitioners in late fifteenth-century central Europe.

        <p style="margin-left: 75px;">
            
    Pagan Regeneration is a book by Harold R. Willoughby, first published in 1929. Subtitled 'A Study of Mystery Initiations in the Graeco-Roman World', this work uses classical historical methodology to give a profound exposé of the ancient religions of Rome and Greece. The author seeks to answer why and how, when Judaism and Christianity are distinctly unmystical, did Pauline mysticism come to be, with its initiations of regeneration, etc. In doing so, he relies heavily on a wide variety of ancient primary sources. His work aims to reveal what can be known of the mysteries and secret rites of these ancient religions.

        <h2 style="margin-top: -1px;margin-left: 75px;">The Fourth Dimension from The Monist - Hermann Schubert</h2>
        <p style="margin-left: 75px;">
            
The tendency to generalise long ago led mathematicians to extend the notion of three-dimensional space, which is the space of sensible representation, and to define aggregates of points, or spaces, of more than three dimensions, with the view of employing these definitions as useful means of investigation. They had no idea of requiring people to imagine four-dimensional things and worlds, and they were even still less remote from requiring of them to believe in the real existence of a four-dimensioned space. 
<br>
<br>
In the hands of mathematicians this extension of the notion of space was a mere means devised for the discovery and expression, by shorter and more convenient ways, of truths applicable to common geometry and to algebra operating with more than three un known quantities. At this stage, however, the spiritualists came in, and coolly took possession of this private property of the mathematicians. They were in great perplexity as to where they should put the spirits of the dead. To give them a place in the world accessible to our senses was not exactly practicable. 
<br>
<br>
They were compelled, therefore, to look around after some terra incognita, which should oppose to the spirit of research inborn in humanity an insuperable barrier. The. residence of the spirits had to be a place inaccessible to our senses and full of mystery to the mind. This property the four-dimensioned space of the mathematicians possessed.

        <p style="margin-left: 75px;">
            
    At the beginning of the second part of The Divine Comedy, Dante and Virgil find themselves at the dawn of a new day. They stand at the shore and see a boat arrive. On the boat are souls brought by an angel who will climb Mount Purgatory - created by the displacement of rock which resulted when Satan's fall created Hell, along with Dante, to rid themselves of sins and proceed to Heaven. Dante cannot waste any time, but he is forced to spend the night outside of Purgatory with other souls, who, unlike him, cannot travel at night. Dante falls asleep, and when he wakes up, Virgil tells him that St. Lucia helped him and carried him straight to the gates of Purgatory.
    <br>
    <br>
    In Purgatory, they have seven terraces to journey through. Before they enter, an angel puts the seven 'P's on Dante's forehead. They correspond to the seven deadly sins. The angel says that every time a terrace of sin is surpassed, a 'P' will be removed. 
    <br>
    <br>
    Purgatorio is the second part of Dante Alighieri's epic poem, Divine Comedy. It follows the journey of Dante through Purgatory, where souls undergo purification before entering Heaven. Dante encounters various penitents and witnesses their struggles for redemption. The poem explores themes of repentance, moral growth, and the relationship between sin and salvation.</p>

        <p style="margin-left: 75px;">
            
    Vodou is among the most misunderstood and maligned of the world's religions. Mama Lola shatters the stereotypes by offering an intimate portrait of Vodou in everyday life. Drawing on a 35 year long friendship with Mama Lola, a Vodou priestess, Karen McCarthy Brown tells tales spanning five generations of Vodou healers in Mama Lola's family, beginning with an African ancestor and ending with Claudine Michel's account of working with Mama Lola after the Haitian earthquake. Out of these stories, in which dream and vision flavor everyday experience and the Vodou spirits guide decision making, Vodou emerges as a religion focused on healing brought about by mending broken relationships between the living, the dead, and the Vodou spirits.
    <br>
    <br>
    Deeply exploring the role of women in religious practices and the related themes of family and of religion and social change, Brown provides a rich context in which to understand the authority that urban Haitian women exercise in the home and in the Vodou temple.
    <br>
    <br>
    Mama Lola: A Vodou Priestess in Brooklyn (1991), an ethnography and biography by American anthropologist Karen McCarthy Brown, focuses on the life of the Vodou priestess Marie Therese Alourdes Macena Champagne Lovinski, better known as Mama Lola. Mama Lola is the most famous Vodou priestess practicing in the United States, and McCarthy Brown’s book is an exhaustive study of her life, her childhood in Haiti, and her roles as a medical doctor, a psychotherapist, a social worker, and a priest. The book explores themes of traditional Haitian religion, race, class struggle, and refuting stereotypes in showing how Mama Lola overcame hardships in her life and rose to prominence by staying true to her roots. The narrative contains tales from Mama Lola’s life interspersed with traditional Haitian folktales and how they relate to her journey. The book, Mama Lola, is considered to have turned the real Mama Lola from a little-known figure to a cultural figure in her community and is used widely in studies of the Haitian religion in universities around the world. In 1991, it was awarded the American Academy of Religion Award for Best First Book in the History of Religion, followed by the Victor Turner Prize in ethnographic writing by the American Anthropological Association.
    <br>
    <br>
    Mama Lola: A Vodou Priestess in Brooklyn is divided into twelve chapters, traveling back to cover the story of her family beginning with her great-great-grandfather Joseph Binbin Mauvant. Following a matriarchal pattern, the book often has a surreal, dreamlike quality in the way it depicts the interactions of Mama Lola and her family with the supernatural beings of the world of Vodou. In the first chapter, Joseph communicates with his wife, Manman Marasa in a dream, telling her that he has left for Africa and is fine, and the family has no need to worry about him anymore. In chapter 2, a powerful Vodou spirit named Azaka speaks directly to the followers of Vodou, reminding them to not lose sight of their roots, the importance of family, and their connection to the land of Haiti.

        <h2 style="margin-top: -1px;margin-left: 75px;">The Golden Bough - James George Frazer</h2>
        <p style="margin-left: 75px;">
            
    The Golden Bough: A Study in Comparative Religion (retitled The Golden Bough: A Study in Magic and Religion in its second edition) is a wide-ranging, comparative study of mythology and religion, written by the Scottish anthropologist Sir James George Frazer. The Golden Bough was first published in two volumes in 1890; in three volumes in 1900; and in twelve volumes in the third edition, published 1906–1915. It has also been published in several different one-volume abridgments. The work was aimed at a wide literate audience raised on tales as told in such publications as Thomas Bulfinch's The Age of Fable, or Stories of Gods and Heroes (1855). The influence of The Golden Bough on contemporary European literature and thought was substantial. 
    <br>
    <br>
    Sir James George Frazer's The Golden Bough: A Study in Magic and Religion is a broad comparative study of mythology and religion. Treating religion as a cultural phenomenon rather than discussing it from a theological perspective, the effect of The Golden Bough on both European literature and the emerging discipline of anthropology was substantial. The pioneering anthropologist Bronislaw Malinowski said of it: "No sooner had I read this great work than I became immersed in it and enslaved by it. I realized then that anthropology, as presented by Sir James Frazer, is a great science, worthy of as much devotion as any of her elder and more exact studies and I became bound to the service of Frazerian anthropology." 
    <br>
    <br>
    THE PRIMARY aim of this book is to explain the remarkable rule which regulated the succession to the priesthood of Diana at Aricia. When I first set myself to solve the problem more than thirty years ago, I thought that the solution could be propounded very briefly, but I soon found that to render it probable or even intelligible it was necessary to discuss certain more general questions, some of which had hardly been broached before. In successive editions the discussion of these and kindred topics has occupied more and more space, the enquiry has branched out in more and more directions, until the two volumes of the original work have expanded into twelve. Meantime a wish has often been expressed that the book should be issued in a more compendious form. This abridgment is an attempt to meet the wish and thereby to bring the work within the range of a wider circle of readers. While the bulk of the book has been greatly reduced, I have endeavoured to retain its leading principles, together with an amount of evidence sufficient to illustrate them clearly. The language of the original has also for the most part been preserved, though here and there the exposition has been somewhat condensed. In order to keep as much of the text as possible I have sacrificed all the notes, and with them all exact references to my authorities. Readers who desire to ascertain the source of any particular statement must therefore consult the larger work, which is fully documented and provided with a complete bibliography.</p>

        <h2 style="margin-top: -1px;margin-left: 75px;">The Life of Apollonius of Tyana - Philostratus, tr. F. C. Conybeare</h2>
        <p style="margin-left: 75px;">
    
    This biography of a first-century C.E. holy man has become one of the most widely discussed literary works of later antiquity. With an engaging style, Philostratus portrays a charismatic teacher and religious reformer from Tyana in Cappadocia (modern central Turkey) who travels across the known world, from the Atlantic to the Ganges. His miracles, which include extraordinary cures and mysterious disappearances, together with his apparent triumph over death, caused pagans to make Apollonius a rival to Jesus of Nazareth.
    <br>
    <br>
   The Life of Apollonius of Tyana has only been once translated in its entirety into English, as long ago as the year 1811, by an Irish clergyman of the name of E. Berwick. It is to be hoped therefore that the present translation will be acceptable to the English reading public; for there is in it much that is very good reading, and it is lightly written. Of its author, Philostratus, we do not know much apart from his own works, from which we may gather that he was born in the island of Lemnos about the year 172 of our era, that he went to Athens as a young man to study rhetoric, and later on to Rome. Here he acquired a reputation as a sophist, and was drawn into what we may call the salon of the literary and philosophic Empress Julia Domna, the wife of Septimius Severus. She put into his hands certain memoirs of Apollonius, the sage of Tyana, who had died in extreme old age.
    <br>
    <br>
    However this be, the evident aim of Philostratus is to rehabilitate the reputation of Apollonius, and defend him from the charge of having been a charlatan or wizard addicted to evil magical practices. This accusation had been levelled against the sage during his life-time by a rival sophist Euphrates, and not long after his death by the author already mentioned, Moeragenes. Unfortunately the orations of Euphrates have perished, and we know little of the work of Moeragenes. Origen, the Christian father, in his work against Celsus, written about the year 240, informs us that he had read it, and that it attacked Apollonius as a magician addicted to sinister practices. It is certain also that the accusations of Euphrates were of similar tendency, and we only need to read a very few pages of this work of Philostratus to see that his chief interest is to prove to the world that these accusations were ill-founded, and that Apollonius was a divinely-inspired sage and prophet, and a reformer along Pythagorean lines of the Pagan religion. It is possible that some of the stories told by Byzantine writers of Apollonius, notably by John Tzetzes, derive from Moeragenes.</p>

        <h2 style="margin-top: -1px;margin-left: 75px;">Counseling and the Demonic - Rodger K. Bufford</h2>
        <p style="margin-left: 75px;">
            
     Throughout human history, the question of demonic influence has been a controversial one. It continues to be so now, when there are two widely held views. According to the first view, demons are everywhere. Those who believe this are preoccupied with demons and with efforts to appease, avoid, or escape them. The second view discounts demons, looking on them as irrelevant, at best, or even nonexistent. Both these views are mistaken. Unfortunately, reality is both less comfortable and more complex than either outlook permits. 
    <br>
    <br>
    This book on counseling and the demonic by Dr. Rodger Bufford is part of the notable Resources for Christian Counseling series, a series which seeks to combine the best insights from psychology with strict adherence to biblical truth.</p>

        <h2 style="margin-top: -1px;margin-left: 75px;">Theogony and Works and Days - Hesiod</h2>
        <p style="margin-left: 75px;">
            
    While Hesiod's Theogony is about the origin of the gods, Works and Days is about human life and the place of mortals in the world. On Hesiod's understanding, human life is harsh, and it is humanity's fate that it must labor to survive. Hesiod's work also praises honesty and emphasizes the importance of justice. This is in part because his work was presented in a disagreement with his brother about their inheritance. Hesiod thought his brother, Perses, was attempting to take more than his fair share.    
    <br>
    <br>
Works and Days can be divided into several sections. The Proem and the Introduction help to situate the text by first asking for the help of the muses, and second addressing Hesiod's brother directly. After those introductory sections, Hesiod devotes a substantial portion of his work to address some of the myths that explain human life - why it is so harsh, why they must labor, etc. After that, Hesiod presents several sections that present practical advice, especially for farmers.</p>

        <p style="margin-left: 75px;">
            
     This book examines the fairies, demons, and nature spirits haunting the margins of Christendom from late-antique Egypt to early modern Scotland to contemporary Amazonia. Contributions from anthropologists, folklorists, historians and religionists explore Christian strategies of encompassment and marginalization, and the ‘small gods’ undisciplined tendency to evade such efforts at exorcism. Lurking in forest or fairy-mound, chuckling in dark corners of the home or of the demoniac’s body, the small gods both define and disturb the borders of a religion that is endlessly syncretistic and in endless, active denial of its own syncretism. The book will be of interest to students of folklore, indigenous Christianity, the history of science, and comparative religion. </p>

        <p style="margin-left: 75px;">
            
    Scholars across many fields have come to realize that ritual is an integral element of human life and a vital aspect of all human societies. Yet, this realization has been slow to develop among scholars of early Christianity. Early Christian Ritual Life attempts to counteract the undervaluing of ritual by placing it at the forefront of early Christian life. Rather than treating ritual in isolation or in a fragmentary way, this book examines early Christian ritual life as a whole. The authors explore an array of Christian ritual activity, employing theory critically and explicitly to make sense of various ritual behaviors and their interconnections. Written by leading experts in their fields, this collection is divided into three parts:
<br>
<br>
• Interacting with the Divine
<br>
• Group Interactions
<br>
• Contesting and Creating Ritual Protocols.
<br>
<br>
This book is ideal for religious studies students seeking an introduction to the dynamic research areas of ritual studies and early Christian practice. </p>

        <h2 style="margin-top: -1px;margin-left: 75px;">Cracks in the Great Wall: UFO and Traditional Metaphysics - Charles Upton</h2>
        <p style="margin-left: 75px;">
            
     Can we really know what UFO's are? The answer is Yes-but only if we study them armed with a kind of knowledge that explains the true and complete structure of the universe—spiritual, psychic, and material—a knowledge that only traditional metaphysics can provide. Science can supply one piece of the puzzle, detective work another, psychic investigation still another. But only metaphysics can put the puzzle together, and give us a complete and satisfying picture of the UFO phenomenon. 
    <br>
    <br>
    Cracks in the Great Wall analyzes of the findings of UFO researcher Jacques Vallee and some of his colleagues in light of the teachings of René Guénon, particularly as expressed in his prophetic masterpiece The Reign of Quantity and the Signs of the Times. According to Guénon, one of the signs of the End Times is the erosion of the energy barrier or 'Great Wall' between the material plane and the world of subtle realities—which is why our world is now being invaded by 'infra-psychic forces' of a terribly destructive nature. Author Charles Upton shows how one of the most obvious examples of this invasion is the UFO phenomenon, including the experience of 'alien abduction'. 
    <br>
    <br>
    A lifetime student of comparative religion and mysticism, he explains the true nature of UFOs, the quality of the world they come from, and also something about the agenda these beings, or some of them, are trying to impose upon our world. If you want to remain merely mystified or fascinated by the UFO phenomenon, this book is not for you. But if you want to understand it, Cracks in the Great Wall will give you the conceptual tools you need. 
    <br>
    <br>
    With the help of UFOlogists Jacques Vallee and John E. Mack, Christian writers C.S. Lewis and Seraphim Rose, Kaballah authority Leo Schaya, and traditionalist writers René Guénon and Whitall Perry, Charles Upton has provided the most comprehensive explanation of the UFO phenomenon yet written. It is difficult to be objective in areas outside our collective view of reality—but if, as the author contends, his argument is based on sound principles, it deserves serious consideration by all who are interested in the UFO phenomenon and its effect on our world. "Charles Upton is a serious writer from whom I have learned much. His writing deserves close attention."—Prof. Huston Smith, author of The World's Religions, etc.</p>

        <p style="margin-left: 75px;">
            
    

"I will tell you how I grew up and how I was trained, about the great sages with whom I lived and what they taught me, not through lectures and books but through experiences."- Swami Rama
<br>
<br>
Reading it, you will discover the human side to this yogic master. He is a young boy, full of mischief. He is a teenager, full of curiosity and adventurous zeal. He is a seeker, with certain strengths and weaknesses. Just like us, he sometimes fails to distinguish the fake gurus from genuine masters, mistaking magic for spiritual achievement.
<br>
<br>
Living with the Himalayan Masters is one of those rare books that contains the seeds of transformation within its pages―sowing those seeds in the heart of the reader, and creating the potential for true spiritual upliftment. These stories record Swami Rama's personal quest for truth and enlightenment―inspiring, illuminating, entertaining, mystifying, and often droll and humorous.
<br>
<br>
This life-changing book will bring you face-to-face with some great twentieth-century masters, including Mataji of Assam, a ninety-six-year-old sage who never slept; Gudari Baba, who taught Swami Rama the value of direct experience; Yogi Sri Aurobindo, who integrated meditation with action; Uria Baba, who demonstrated that every human being has the potential for healing; and Mahatma Gandhi.
<br>
<br>
Read the humbling story of the man who founded the Himalayan Institute, and the great teachers who molded him into a Himalayan Master.</p>

        <h2 style="margin-top: -1px;margin-left: 75px;">Gateways Through Stone and Circle: A Manual of Evocation for the Planetary Intelligences - Ashen Chassan</h2>
        <p style="margin-left: 75px;">
            
     "Gateways Through Stone and Circle" is a compendium of personal experiences and research from a traditional ceremonial magician working through a classical book of magic. This volume is a complete and in-depth study in the "Art of Drawing Spirits into Crystals" as found in Francis Barrett's, The Magus, and accredited to Trithemius of Spanheim. 
    <br>
    <br>
    Detailed research, personal experimentation, and evoking each of the seven planetary archangels and intelligences to visible and auditory presence are presented within. You will find descriptions of the seven planetary archangels as witnessed by the author, instructions for building each of the traditional implements and furniture to the specifications of the grimoire, as well as detailed illustrations of the author's actual equipment. Items such as the infamous Book of Spirits or Liber Spirituum are explained in detail so the reader will know how to make and use one. 
    <br>
    <br>
    Chapters also describe methods for improving scrying abilities, working with a partner, and conducting the entire ceremony from beginning to end. Everything to make this art work is explained in incredibly vivid detail. The purpose for this book is to present a workable manual wherein the aspiring magus can replicate a valuable system of magic to achieve successful and reliable discourse with some of the most powerful beings in the cosmos. "No other book has unveiled how to perform this experiment successfully within the traditional manner." This work is not a theoretical analysis of a historic manuscript from an academic scholar, nor is it based on presumption and guess work. It is a modern day grimoire from a traditional grimorist. It is drawn from one who has been studying and practicing Western occult magic for nearly two decades and has recreated the procedures that achieve results. The methods contained within are constructed as closely to the original text as possible and filled with suggestions and points to assist the beginning magician as well as the advanced practitioner. </p>

        <h2 style="margin-top: -1px;margin-left: 75px;">The Ring of the Nibelung: Siegfried & The Twilight of the Gods - Trans. Margaret Armour</h2>
        <p style="margin-left: 75px;">
            
    The "Ring of the Nibelung" consists of four music-dramas-"Das Rheingold" (The Rhinegold), "Die Walküre" (The Valkyr), "Siegfried," and "Götterdämmerung" (Dusk of the Gods). The "books" of these were written in inverse order. Wagner made a dramatic sketch of the Nibelung myth as early as the autumn of 1848, and between then and the autumn of 1850 he wrote the "Death of Siegfried." This subsequently became the "Dusk of the Gods." Meanwhile Wagner’s ideas as to the proper treatment of the myth seem to have undergone a change. "Siegfried’s Death" ended with Brünnhilde leading Siegfried to Valhalla, -- dramatic, but without the deeper ethical significance of the later version, when Wagner evidently conceived the purpose of connecting the final catastrophe of his trilogy with the "Dusk of the Gods," or end of all things, in Northern mythology, and of embodying a profound truth in the action of the music-dramas. This metaphysical significance of the work is believed to be sufficiently explained in the brief synopsis of the plot of the trilogy and in the descriptive musical and dramatic analyses below.
<br>
<br>
In the autumn of 1850 when Wagner was on the point of stretching out the music of "Siegfried’s Death," he recognized that he must lead up to it with another drama, and "Young Siegfried," afterwards "Siegfried," was the result. This in turn he found incomplete, and finally decided to supplement it with the "Valkyr" and "Rhinegold."
<br>
<br>
"Das Rheingold" was produced in Munich, at the Court Theatre, September 22, 1869; "Die Walküre," on the same stage, June 20, 1870. "Siegfried" and "Dusk of the Gods" were not performed until 1876, when they were produced at Bayreuth.</p>

     This collection of reports of elfin creatures in Wales, Ireland, Scotland, and Brittany ranks among the most scholarly works ever published on the subject. The Fairy-Faith in Celtic Countries begins with the author's account of firsthand testimony from living sources, classified under individual countries and introduced by leading authorities on anthropology and folklore. The next section concerns the recorded traditions of Celtic literature and mythology, followed by an examination of a variety of theories and their religious aspects. The book concludes with a remarkably rational case for the reality of fairy life. Narrated with an engaging sense of wonder, this volume offers a valuable resource for students of anthropology and Celtic lore, as well as hours of delightful reading for fairy enthusiasts. </p>

        <h2 style="margin-top: -1px;margin-left: 75px;">An Experiment with Time - J. W. Dunne</h2>
        <p style="margin-left: 75px;">
        
    An Experiment with Time is a book by the British soldier, aeronautical engineer and philosopher J. W. Dunne (1875–1949) about his precognitive dreams and a theory of time which he later called "Serialism". First published in March 1927, the book was widely read. Although never accepted by mainstream scientists or philosophers, it has influenced imaginative literature ever since. Dunne published four sequels: The Serial Universe, The New Immortality, Nothing Dies and Intrusions?       
    <br>
    <br>
    The first half of the book describes a number of precognitive dreams, most of which Dunne himself had experienced. His key conclusion was that such precognitive visions foresee future personal experiences by the dreamer and not more general events.
    <br>
    <br>
    The second half develops a theory to try and explain them. Dunne's starting point is the observation that the moment of "now" is not described by science. Contemporary science described physical time as a fourth dimension and Dunne's argument led to an endless sequence of higher dimensions of time to measure our passage through the dimension below. Accompanying each level was a higher level of consciousness. At the end of the chain was a supreme ultimate observer.
    <br>
    <br>
    According to Dunne, our wakeful attention prevents us from seeing beyond the present moment, whilst when dreaming that attention fades and we gain the ability to recall more of our timeline. This allows fragments of our future to appear in pre-cognitive dreams, mixed in with fragments or memories of our past. Other consequences include the phenomenon known as deja vu and the existence of life after death.</p>

        <h2 style="margin-top: -1px;margin-left: 75px;">Passport to Magonia: On UFOs, Folklore, and Parallel Worlds - Jacques Vallee</h2>
        <p style="margin-left: 75px;">
            
     It is readily acknowledged that our time has surpassed all epochs in history for the accumulation of technical knowledge, physical power over our environment, and economic might. It is less often pointed out, however, that our age has generated, and continues to generate, mythical material almost unparalleled in quantity and quality in the rich records of human imagination. More precisely, people have very frequently reported the observation of wonderful aerial objects, variously designated as flying saucers, unidentified flying objects (UFOs), and so on; among these narratives descriptions of landings made by these craft are commonplace; and that quite a few accounts purport to inform us of the physical characteristics, the psychological behaviour, and the motivation of their occupants. 
    <br>
    <br>
    But investigators have neglected to recognize one important perspective of the phenomenon: the fact that beliefs identical to those held today have recurred throughout recorded history and under forms best adapted to the believer's country, race, and social regime. If we take a wide sample of this historical material, we find that it is organized around one central theme: visitation by an aerial people from one or more remote, legendary countries. The names and attributes vary, but the main idea clearly does not. Magonia, heaven, hell, Elfland - all such places have in common one characteristic: we are unable to reach them alive, except on very special occasions. Emissaries from these supernatural abodes come to earth, sometimes under human form and sometimes as monsters. They perform wonders. 
    <br>
    <br>
    They serve man or fight him. They influence civilizations through mystical revelation. They seduce earth women, and the few heroes who dare seek their friendship find the girls from Elfland endowed with desires that betray a carnal, rather than purely aerial, nature. These matters are the subject of Passport to Magonia, Jacques Vallee's seminal master-work that changed our understanding of the UFO phenomenon. An instant classic when first published in 1969, the book remains a must-have resource for anybody interested in the topics of UFOs and alien contact, as well as those fascinated by fairy folklore and other paranormal encounters. </p>

        <h2 style="margin-top: -1px;margin-left: 75px;">Eskimo Folk-Tales - Knud Rasmussen</h2>
        <p style="margin-left: 75px;">
            
    Knud Rasmussen (1879–1933), the child of a Danish missionary, grew up in western Greenland among the Kalaallit people, whose culture fascinated him from an early age. As a child, he learned to speak their language and, as he grew older, also learned from them how to hunt, drive dog sleds, and survive in harsh arctic weather. After a brief and not very successful career as an actor and opera singer in Denmark, Rasmussen returned to to the polar regions as an explorer and anthropologist, writing travelogues and ethnographies including the highly popular People of the Polar North (1908). By the end of his life, he was known as the “father of Eskimology”.
    <br>
     <br>
The translator W. W. Worster’s claim, in his introduction to Rasmussen’s Eskimo Folktales, that “No man is better qualified to tell the story of Greenland, or the stories of people” will rightly raise some eyebrows today. Yet, all things considered, Rasmussen appears to have been both familiar with and relatively respectful of the people he called “Eskimos” (an Algonquin word for their neighbors to the north not typically used by Inuit people). His collection of their tales, “taken down from the lips of the Eskimo story-tellers themselves”, offers a fascinating glimpse into a complex culture.</p>
